Blog Site - Built via Jekyll


## Blog site

This site has multiple purposes, originally made to have a place to post my photography and also blog about stuff. However, also now made to be a place to list projects and learning progress on different languages. Currently planning on to learn about ReactJS and also Unity/C++.
