## Welcome to my site

I've added disqus as a comment system for this blog. So obviously, making things simple is that there will be some basic rules in regards to manners when commenting.
* Be civilised - don't be an ass, swearing is fine as long as it not directed towards someone as an insult. So, remember to avoid:
  * name-calling
  * ad hominem attacks
  * Responding to a postâ€™s tone instead of its actual content.
  * knee-jerk contradiction

* Don't spam the comment section, report spam/bots for obvious reasons.

* Don't self promote; I'm a bit relaxed here as long as it is within a discussion and you want to show something, no problem. But straight out promotion is prohibited thanks.

* Languages: currently most content here is in English. However Japanese and Chinese is also ok here.
