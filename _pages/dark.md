## {{page.excerpt}} :

Its a hard topic to start with. It honestly is and I reckon despite all the attempt to persuade myself otherwise.
No matter what reason I come up with; to make a living off travel blogging or to develop my photography to a professional level. No matter how much I desire these goals, dreams and even my old dreams to work for a tech firm like AMD, Intel or Sony or successful businesses. I always end up crushed under the social pressure and the expectation that I will do well.

Knowing the reality of how hard it is to actually be successful and that the support needed, I feel like I reach short of my goals in life. Its a kind of despair where I find no motivation to lead, to be some role model. I once thought I knew what I wanted to do, do something in the technology space, where I could innovate, improve and help solve problems. Use a lot of critical thinking skills. I wanted to work for microsoft, google or anything in that area. I dreamed big, wanting to startup some life changing technology. I wanted to be different to my father, who may be a genius in his own right.
I wanted to prove to the world that I am someone worth remembering for.

#### But...

I realised...I realised I am not strong enough to stand up and work by myself. I realised that I was alone, my father made sacrifices for his career, in turn, he is not someone I know very well and as of such I am not as close to my father or his side of the family as I would be able to. It is worth noting that living in a country 10000km away also added to the whole situation. Similarly on my mother's side, family was far and few. I mean by itself, this is not a huge issue, you'll always find people that want to be around you. Sure, but just so happens, people around me generally don't initiate contact, a phone call is far too rare for my friends. I think I only know one person who I actually can call and talk to. I don't want to rely on her as I know its hard for her to listen to my problems.

So going a little bit back, we have a somewhat dysfunctional family, that don't get me wrong I care and truly cared too much for to a point where I was broken a year back. But during High School, I wasn't too sure how to socialize, how to make friends, I had a hard time even when I was younger, social anxiety sucks like a bitch. So I was rather quiet after a while, or talked to much, I had barely gone out with friends of any kind, because frankly I didn't make meaningful or only a few school friends, in my second to last year, someone reached out to me, it was honestly one of the happiest things I could remember of my final years in high school, a person that I called a friend, he asked me to hang out at his place, twice, we gamed, listened to some really cool indie music, talked about IT and I was happy, except that by the next year he graduated. So back to my lonely self.

At the time I had a huge crush on this Japanese exchange student, and I am not sure how, but I asked her out. I got I don't know you well enough trope and so never really got an answer. But as immature or inexperienced in making good connections with people. I channeled my anger to fps games, spending an addiction like spread, it got me through, very bitter and angry perhaps.   I did better for my school work the year before, in my last year, but grades were not something to be proud of, I couldn't get into the course I wanted (engineering), but it was more than enough to get into computer science under the faculty of science.  

I also took japanese, to continue from what I studied in high school, it was through correspondence so I didn't do so well.
and something I tried to do in University was to be energetic towards making friends, female, male or whatever, I did it with an open enough mind, sure I had view points that pushed me away from certain groups of people, but I tried and tried. In the second semester, on the first day of Japanese, this girl sat right in front of me and I never actually planned to interact with her that day, but she came to talk to me after class and we had a fun introduction conversation. From then on, I could say she was the first friend that I really connected with, I enjoyed so much just hanging out and listening to her conversations, her unique hobby, the friend groups she had which she even introduced to me and that she would spend time with me as a friend, but on the first day when I did met her, I knew that she didn't want anything more than just friends and so as time went on, the more I enjoyed listening to her and more I admired her as a person, despite her flaws and her weaknesses...I ended up caring too much and had a crush on her. I never planned to tell her, to bottle those emotions up, because I was made to believe it was the right thing to do, to not bother others with what is on my mind.

#### However, fate...
had other plans, at the end of the year, where I had to move out of university dorms, through my friend, she asked if I liked her and through my friend, I figured out that he spoiled the beans and confronted, for the next month I couldn't control my emotions, it flooded out like a rapid water but of pain. I would wake up multiple times a night crying, sad, depressed. She wasn't perfect, but she helped convince me to visit japan, and I wouldn't say it was a perfect trip, but I was so much more happier than I thought I could be. I mean sure I wished she was there. I wished she would have been a closer friend. But I was an emotional wreak, for the next half year, we drifted apart, as she focused onto to her dancing hobby and wanted to focus at school. She had too much on her plate and didn't pass that course that semester. So from then on in practice never saw her again. People drift apart I learnt, that this is normal and I regret how it turned out, I wished I knew how to continue being friends. I had a work friend who really supported me when I needed help and he is one of those people that I respect, he lent his hand out to me, when I need that bowl of curry(speaking of which I because a regular because of how happy it made me just sitting there for 5 mins eating), the bowl of noodles.

Funny enough, my mother meet a japanese exchange student and she exchanged my number with hers. We talked, we meet, we had fun, I really liked hanging out, but I wasn't sure what she thought of me, but the fact she was leaving back to japan, made it unlikely to be of anything serious.

So second year of university was hard, I hanged out with "friends", but honestly never actually formed strong friendships, except with the people I rented with, its a story for another time, but those guys were great, they saw me at my worst and they are people that I could consider friends for a lifetime, even if they really don't talk much(or that we get the chance to now). At university I felt alone for that entire year, I wasn't hanging out much, or talking to people that I wanted to be around and  I made friends with some more japanese students, got to meet with them and have conversations/some really cool alumni's who I consider friends, I even meet them this time when I went to Japan, also meet the japanese girl that my mother introduced.

Halfway through the 3rd year, I got to meet a childhood friend in china, from when I was 7. I honestly forgotten who she was, but we kicked it off and I was enjoying my time reconnecting.
### But alas fate had ideas.
You see my mother and her mother once were coworkers and so there was a lot of negative reaction to me socializing with this girl in the chance that we date and things dont work out. I wished I could have dated her. She was kind, generally someone that I felt happy being around. Ironically, she had a boyfriend already, so there was no real reason to be worried, I didn't find this out, until asked me how she should get her mother to accept her boyfriend on my birthday(for reference having a birthday right after christmas is terrible everyone is travelling) and for that year I was celebrating it by myself. I baked a cheesecake for myself, the only whos called me was my mother, brother and my auntie living in australia. It was probably the loneliest birthday I had.

Carrying on 4th year. I meat some exchange students from tohoku Japan. I wanted to make friends and well surprise, surprise, a girl decided to chat with me. I was attracted I guess, I want to learn more about these friends as well. But again this did not stick. I was trying to continue the conversation to 1. improve my japanese, 2. make better friends with her. But for the first time, I understood what it meant to be culturally different. I realised that I could never really become close to someone that is Japanese. I learnt that the disparity of how I viewed to make friends, doesn't work with Japanese. It was at that point, that I begin to lose interest in creating friendships, or even further relationships in Japan. It felt pointless, to be honestly. Like every time I talked to someone, I felt less real, less me by the minute.

My grades compared to first year of university, got worse and worse..not because I couldn't do the assignments, but I never was motivated enough to properly study for my exams. I would be at 80-90% assignment-wise and then drop to 60-70% due to tests.
I binged anime, games, worked every weekend to get my mind off things, make impulse purchases instead of saving up, because I despised money and it made me happy. Ironically, the one thing I need now, to survive and make a living.

So this was my university experience. There are moments, where I was less than perfect and that I was a "nice" person. I learnt that its impossible to care for every person you meet. To have friendships like the extroverts I met and enjoy the alone time like the introverts I met. I couldn't just be one or the other. But had to be right in the middle of the spectrum. I wanted friends like nothing else, I also wanted to be alone. I wanted a girlfriend, because I couldn't handle life as it is.  I wanted someone close that I could share the quiet moments and the busy moments with. You could say this is all in my head, which I would tell you probably you are correct. Its easy to just say, its not your time, you haven't met the person, there is plenty of fish in the sea. But this sense of defeated, will follow me in the shadows, to haunt me that I couldn't live up to the person I wanted to be, to stand up for the right things. to be strong in moments like these.

### Right after university
I decided to not go home to my hometown in my country. I stayed at the place I rented with my friends. (credit:my best friend who I will mention allowed me to talk, give opinion and empathize with me, really got me through my darkest hours, for that I am forever grateful to her). At the time, the family issues that had been building up was something I was dealing with, but at the same time I was trying to find a job/get full time hours and so I could survive financially by myself, also met another girl from class again. This person, is unique, in the sense of her thinking was foolish and immature. At the time, I was having a hard time with all the trouble in life. The stress came rushing through, but she was the friend that talked to me while all this hardship was going on, so I confessed and in her response, she was afraid of a break-up despite not being in a relationship since high school. A term that was used by someone I talked to; was that I rather starve, because I am afraid that I'll choke. I liked her, I was really concerned though, she had a lot of unhealthy ways of dealing with her stress, in essence a true ticking time bomb. But I said love instead of like, so in part it is my fault for making that mistake. That friendship, didn't last a month, I got really depressed near the end of the friendship and she cut ties, saying talking to me would make me more depressed which honestly makes very little sense, but she has the right. It was tough I couldn't get over it. It took a lot of time, and an online friend, who I again without self control, liked funny enough, she was taken, it is still amazing though, despite never actually talking in real life or hearing each others voice, she managed to save me from my despair for someone who didn't want my empathy.

I realised at that point that I had to change, that I shouldn't care about people as much as I once did.
So I happened to chance on the international disney college program, I got in, I applied, I had to clean up my flat, store my things at my mothers place and off I go on adventure to a foreign country, to work for a mouse. It was hard, everyone was somewhat of an extrovert, I had a hard time fitting in, I felt unhappy working there; there was this time in walmart, where I had to listen my mother yell me about my brother who did something wrong. Yet, I persisted, I tried to stay cheerful and for a brief moment, it was all worth it. For the first time, someone literally handed me their number on apiece of paper, from simple saying I never had mac and cheese in amercia. Then she invited me to have pasta with her, and then the next day we went on a "friend" date, I reckon it was a hang out. But that was a day to remember. Started off at disney springs, buying loose leaf tea from a tea shop, smelled incredible and then we went off to epcot theme park to ride some rides(spaceship earth, mission space), but to visit the japanese department store there, cause I really wanted a mug. She actually bought coconut cocktail that she really disliked and ended up passsing to me to finish. we ended up in magic kingdom with her friend and rode two rides, thunder mountain and splash mountain. It ended with fireworks going off as we finished splash mountain, we sat next to each other and in her eyes was this sparkle that you don't see very often, that she was super happy. Well it didn't quite end there, it got to the point where we back to the dormitories, but she ended up inviting me for tea, which did happen, but vodka also happened right after that. so that was the first time I ever got drunk in my life and she decided to ask if I liked her and it ended up that she and I both drunkly liked each other. Nothing much more happened that night.

The next day though, I asked her if she remembered anything and she gave me the most reasonable response, ie we got along great, we had a lot in common. She didn't remember everything though, I did. and when hanged out for pasta after work the next time, we had a laugh about it and we cuddled, we talked about what we wanted, a relationship? children? food preferences? taking it slow, the whole nine yards. That sunday we went to a piano bar with her roommate and we ended up having a great time, so as we went home she grabbed my hand which I was happy to hold. So got a little closer. On a rainy day at work we ended up working at the same popcorn stand and we ended up going home together, I waited for her to finish. We went to walmart and I was so excited I think she really found it amusing, we got to her flat and we cuddled, and for the first time in my life I got to kiss someone. We hanged out another day at hollywood studio theme park, and I guess that was it. We cuddled, kissed, ate pizza and went home, because of work the next day.

the next day I found out my mentor in life, had past away a week into my new life and unsurprisingly, this girl, that liked me decided sometime around then, maybe it was the night we had pizza, maybe it was the next day when I went to her place to grief. But she decided to end it then. We weren't official, but it was something special to me. She broke it off on fb messenger, started ghosting me and as I found eventually spread rumours that I was head over heels for her, despite her making it clear she didn't want anything more?! I'm disappointed in this behaviour, but for what its worth, I take away the fact that I can be liked and that really helped. I mean sure the following month was tough, depressed as all hell, drinking daily, sometimes even drunk to work. Eventually to the point that I get marked for termination and had to leave USA within 48 hours.

## So
I once again step into the land of japan, meeting old friends, and making new friends. I met up with the girl and other people from tohoku, but as much as I talked to them that night as much fun as the first time ever karaoke was with them and as good as their hospitality. I felt distance, I wasn't there. I met some cool person, there was one that I really liked but unfortunately left the next day, lived in apart of the world that I was not part of. I met a couple of friends, made friends with them, visited kyoto with them. At some point after leaving for china to visit relatives and job hunting, I realised I had crush on the girl and did confess, of course that is not before assisting confessions between the couple.
I want to wish them best of luck, but I also want to destroy it.

# So you maybe wondering why this is written, why this exists, why I expose myself like this?

There is no particular reason that can be used to define why this page exists, I simple desire to express myself. Maybe its the desire to do things, maybe its my inability to control my emotions, maybe it is the empathy I have for my friends no matter how new they are too me. I had once a friend who told me that I see the good in everyone. (side story: confessed to her while in the month where I was daily drinking and pushed to far without considering her feelings, sincerely regret my actions)(side story 2: she was also a friend of a friend that in retrospect despite what her friends told me, the mutual friend probably liked me; except that girl would always complain, try to fix me.)
And I truly tried to, I created a trap where I keep falling in like an idiot, time and time again. I let myself fall into this infatuated state and yet no one can help me, no one can save me from my own despair...except

# myself

## But

### that is hard.

To bounce back.
To improve from past mistakes.
To aim for a bright future.
To try again.
To fail again.
To try again and again.

My name in chinese character, means bright; something I always believed to be true is that the brighter something burns, the darker the shadow and so I believe, this darkness is something that I need to get used to and live with it.

Maybe one of these days, I would be able to see the end of the tunnel, maybe one day I can feel like I belong somewhere,
maybe one day I'll find that love that I so dearly desire and wish for.

Perhaps that is my downfall, perhaps its something that cannot come with wanting and desiring. I don't know the answer. All I am is hurt, broken and at times stumbling to the next day. Its not easy to breath when there is a haze in your mind.

# Or

Perhaps I am just too human. Maybe its the condition of being human.

ps. no self harm intentions, this is just a honest piece of myself and my darkness. Judge me all you want, but its not something that is written to please others, its a mark that I'll make.  

pss. this isn't a finite run through the last five years of my life, but its plenty.
