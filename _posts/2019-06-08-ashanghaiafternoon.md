As it stands, since I made the website, I haven't really worked on it. Been relaxing after my trip in Japan and also trying to get motivation to start studying Japanese and also more importantly programming languages, I plan to brush up on Java, JS(react), and C++(probably via a widely able engine like unity).

I also finally applied to a couple job applications around, well I'm not likely going to get them, but its always worth a shot. Got to keep trying! ^^ Can't be always afraid of being rejected.
